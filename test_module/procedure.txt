Firstly I have written a module named hello.c and used init and exit funtion. In init and exit function I have written "Hello World" and "Good bye"
message respectively using printk that goes to log buffer after succesfully loading and unloading the module(hello.ko file). Later I verified the message
using dmesg command.
